                            DARC UPDATE LOG

27/08/09 stg2d NRB
Fix GENSUM INTEGER*4 bug (was already "known" - sigh**2).

26/08/09 stg2d NRB
Fix NJGRAF bug in CUTNL (was already "known" - sigh).

25/08/09 stg2d NRB
Comment-out last references to INTCC (no longer used) so that it can
compile under Fortran77.

20/08/09 stg2d NRB
Restrict N+1 correlation function generation to those formed by the
first -NCFGP NR CSFs. Default, all, unchanged.

26/05/08 stg1d_orb v12.3 NRB
Additional checks.

22/05/08 stg1d_int v12.1 NRB
Added ITC(50) defining dimension test. Basically skips INTD2, which
is where all the time goes in DRMPS (calculating the C-C Slater integrals).
Minor tweaks/speed-ups introduced.

19/05/08 stg0d v12.1 NRB
Version 0.9 is default, no write of TARGET.SH is default (GRASP dump
was, and is, MCDF.DAT). None interactive version available for batch runs.

12/05/08 stg1d_orb v12.3 NRB
Minor fixes and tidy-up.

12/05/08 stg1d_orb v12.3 NRB
Minor mods. This version reproduces Poet-Temkin results for H of RMPS.
Non-DRMPS operation did not work (obviously so) in v12.2 - now fixed.

27/03/08 stg1d_orb v12.2 NRB
Now correctly recovers original surface amplitudes and e-energies.

24/03/08 stg1d_orb v12.1 NRB
First implementation of new orthogonalization routine for combining continuum 
basis with L-spinor basis.
